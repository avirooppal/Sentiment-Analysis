# Sentiment Analysis Emoji Mood Classifier

This Python script utilizes the [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) library to perform sentiment analysis on input text and categorize it into positive, negative, or neutral moods. The mood is represented by an emoji and a sentiment score, encapsulated within a convenient data class.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** The script leverages TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of the input text, providing a polarity score that indicates whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Mood Categorization:** The sentiment score is used to categorize the mood into three classes: üòä Good (positive), üò† Unhappy (negative), and üòê Neutral.

- **Threshold Customization:** Users can customize the threshold for mood classification by adjusting the `threshold` parameter, allowing for fine-tuning based on specific use cases.

- **Continuous User Interaction:** The script includes a loop for continuous user interaction, making it easy to input various texts and receive real-time mood feedback.
